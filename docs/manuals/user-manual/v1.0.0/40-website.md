# Website

Small but handy controls for your public site while the app is young.

News Bar
- A top ribbon for announcements (launches, promos)
- Primary and secondary lines, with on/off toggle

Blogs
- Draft, publish, and manage posts
- Keep excerpts short; link to deeper content as needed

Note: The actual public site is yours to design. These tools give you a running start.
