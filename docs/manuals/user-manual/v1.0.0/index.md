# Founder Express — Employee Portal User Manual (v1.0.0)

Welcome to the Employee Portal user manual for Founder Express. This guide helps new team members get productive fast in a boilerplate that ships with:

- An empty public landing site (for you to design)
- An empty client portal (for you to build on)
- A full employee portal (this manual)

Use this manual as a map: skim the sections, then dive into the pages you use most. Keep it lightweight; the product is meant to be fast and friendly.

## Who this is for
- Employees, founders, and operators using the internal portal to run day‑to‑day work.

## What you’ll learn
- How to navigate the portal
- How to manage customers, vendors, email, finance, website bits, tags
- Where to change personal settings, and how privacy/cookies work
