# Customers (CRM)

A focused database for people and organizations you work with.

Key views
- Database: search and filter customers/vendors
- Archive & Removed: restore or clean up
- Merge: combine duplicates (customer email as the key)

Customer profiles
- General info, contact info, tags, notes
- Vendor support (suppliers) shares the same CRM foundation

Workflow vibe: add, search, act. Keep records tidy; your teammates will thank you.
