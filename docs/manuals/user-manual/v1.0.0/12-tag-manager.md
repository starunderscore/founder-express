# Tag Manager

Organization‑wide labels that help you segment customers and vendors.

Basics
- Create tags with optional color and description
- Apply tags in CRM profiles
- Archive/remove tags you no longer use

Guideline: Keep tag names short and meaningful. Fewer, better tags beat many vague ones.
