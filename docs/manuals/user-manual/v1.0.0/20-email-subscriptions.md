# Email Subscriptions

Two simple tools to communicate with your audience:

Newsletters
- Draft, preview, and send messages to your master list
- Copy/paste a signup form for your website

Waiting Lists
- Create lists for launches and betas
- Collect emails, draft and send updates to that list

Rule of thumb: write short, clear emails; send them when they’re useful.
