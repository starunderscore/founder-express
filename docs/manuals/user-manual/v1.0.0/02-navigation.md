# Navigation Overview

The Employee Portal uses a left sidebar for primary sections and a simple header with context actions.

Sidebar basics
- Users: Customers, Email Subscriptions, Employees
- Content: Website (News Bar, Blogs)
- Financial: Overview, Invoices, Reports, Settings
- Tools: Tag Manager, Reports, Company Settings, Admin Settings

Header basics
- Back button to the parent area
- Title + short description
- Right‑side actions (Add, New, Configure)

Pro tip: Look for the subtle icons beside section titles. They’re quick anchors for your brain.
