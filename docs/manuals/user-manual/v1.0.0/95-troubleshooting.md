# Troubleshooting

I can’t find a page
- Use the sidebar search (browser find), or navigate via section cards

I don’t have access
- Open Profile → Roles to see your current access
- Ask an admin to add the role you need

Email or finance looks empty
- This starter ships light; add sample data or connect providers under Admin Settings

Something looks wrong
- Refresh, sign out/in, or ask your admin to check the console/server logs
