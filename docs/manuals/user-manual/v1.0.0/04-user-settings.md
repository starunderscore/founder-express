# User Settings

The gear in the sidebar’s account bar opens User Settings — a table‑of‑contents view for personal preferences.

Appearance
- Switch between light, dark, or system theme

Security
- Change your password (reauthentication flow)

Philosophy: Keep personal settings fast and minimal; the portal is here to help you work, not slow you down.
