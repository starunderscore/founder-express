# Employee Portal User Manual (v1.0.0)

A concise, practical guide to using the Founder Express Employee Portal that ships with this boilerplate:

- Empty landing site (public)
- Empty client portal (for your customers)
- Full employee portal (this manual)

Use this to ramp quickly and keep momentum. It’s intentionally light — just enough to point you in the right direction.

Audience
- Employees, founders, and operators working in the internal portal

## What’s inside
- Getting Started: sign in, find your way
- Navigation: sidebar + header patterns
- Customers (CRM): customers, vendors, notes, tags, merge
- Email Subscriptions: newsletters and waiting lists
- Finance: invoices, products/prices, taxes, reports
- Website: news bar and blogs
- Settings: user/company/admin, policies

Where to start
- Manual landing: `docs/manuals/user-manual/v1.0.0/index.md`

## How to read
- Skim the topics relevant to today’s work
- Learn the rhythm: search → act → archive/restore
- Prefer simple workflows; grow complexity later

## Version
- Manual version: 1.0.0
- App starter: opinionated, minimal, fast to adapt

Happy shipping.
