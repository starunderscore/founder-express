# Finance

Keep a lightweight pulse: invoices, products/prices, taxes, and simple reports.

Overview
- High‑level stats: paid, outstanding, late

Invoices
- Add invoices, mark paid, filter by status

Products & Prices
- Stripe‑like model for one‑time and recurring prices

Taxes
- Define rates, enable/disable, set defaults

Reports
- Essentials like A/R aging and taxes summary

Philosophy: start simple, export what you need, grow as you go.
