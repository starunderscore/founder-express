# Getting Started

This manual assumes you signed in to the Employee Portal. If you haven’t:

1) Ask an admin to add you as an employee
2) Use the invite or sign‑in link
3) Land on the dashboard and explore

What’s included in this boilerplate
- Empty landing site (public) — your marketing site
- Empty client portal — space to build customer features
- Employee portal — everything you see here for internal ops

Tip: Don’t try to learn everything at once. Start with your job‑to‑be‑done (customers, email, finance…), then branch out.
